            </li>
            <li>
                Turn heat to medium and place other tortilla on top. 
                After about 5 minutes, gently lift edge of quesadilla to see if bottom tortilla is starting to brown. 
                It should take a little longer, but keep a close eye on it.

            <li>
                Once it is golden brown, flip the quesadilla and brown other side, checking frequently. 
                Slide on to a cutting board. Let sit for a couple of minutes and then cut into quarters.
